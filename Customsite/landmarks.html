<li><a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/historyculture/hm69.htm">HM69 Missile Base</a></li>
<img src="images/missilebase.jpg" alt="Missile Base">
<p>The missile site was built in 1964 in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis and was closed in 1979 when it was turned over to the National Park Service. There are 22 buildings on the site that are accessible to visitors, and
     There is even a restored, but disarmed Nike-Hercules missile that is available for viewing and the missile assembly site is well preserved.

<li><a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/historyculture/royal-palm.htm">Royal Palm State Park</a></li>
<img src="images/royalpalmpark.jpg" alt="palm park" width="450">
<p>The lodge was built in 1919 by John F. Humphrey for the caretaker, Charles A. Mosier. The lodge was run by the parks caretakers until 1947, when the National Park Service aquired it and built a new visitors center 
    in 1952. The Royal Palm Lodge had been renamed the "Jack's Hotel and Motel" after it was sold. It was lost in 1992 to Hurricane Andrew and a small monument was built in the place it once stood.

<li><a href="https://www.nps.gov/ever/learn/historyculture/historic-roads.htm">Old Ingraham Road</a></li>
<img src="images/ingrahamroad.jpg" alt="ingraham road" width="450">
<p>
    The road was named after James E. Ingraham, president of the Model Land Company, who worked with Henry M. Flagler for the development of the area. The road was built for extending the railroad through the Everglades.
Numerous problems delayed the project and the onset of World War 1 made it impossible to extend the road to Cape Sable. Today, most of the road has been incorporated into Florida's highways, some parts have been removed,
and other parts are used as park administration roads.
